# Renaer Neverember
![[RenaerNeverember.jpg]]
Renaer Neverember is the son of [[Dagult Neverember]], the former Open Lord of Waterdeep. He moved to Neverwinter when his father was forcibly ousted from his position due to charges of corruption. However, he has recently returned to Waterdeep, claiming that he and his father are estranged and that he wants to establish his own positive legacy.

He was kidnapped by cultists and was held in the Right Hand of Nessus until he was rescued by Burgell and Company. While kidnapped he was interrogated about something called the "Stone of Golorr" that is supposed to lead to a hidden supply of gold that was embezzled from the city by Dagult Neverember.

Renaer claims that he doesn’t know anything about his father’s actions and that the Stone of Golorr is just a myth.
