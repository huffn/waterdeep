# J.B. Nevercott
![[JBNevercott.jpeg]]
J.B. is the perfect nobleman. With fine clothes, and an even finer hat, he is the talk of whichever room he currently resides in.

When his errand boy [[Fel'rekt Lafeen]] was rescued from cultists, he gifted the adventurers who saved him with the deed to Trollskull Manor as thanks.
