Dagult had been the Open Lord of Waterdeep until he was ousted by [[Laeral Silverhand]] while he spent time rebuilding Neverwinter after it was attacked by Maegera.

It is no secret that that Dagult had been embezzling money, as that was the charge he was dealt when removed from position, but after a lengthy investigation, no money has been found yet.
