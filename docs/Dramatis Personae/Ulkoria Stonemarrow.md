# Ulkoria Stonemarrow

Ulkoria Stonemarrow has defended Waterdeep with her magic more times than she can recall. She is known as “the Gargoyle” because her face is usually frozen in a scowl that frightens both adults and children. She takes her shield guardian around with her wherever she goes.

Ulkoria once owned Trollskull Manor and watches over all the future owners to make sure that they are staying out of trouble.
