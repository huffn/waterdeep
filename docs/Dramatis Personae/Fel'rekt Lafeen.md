# Fel'rekt Lafeen
![[FelrektLafeen.jpeg]]
Fel'rekt had been on the lookout for cultist activity, and found more than he expected. While tailing [[Renaer Neverember]] who cultists had been targeting, he ended up getting caught while breaking into the Right Hand of Nessus.

After being rescued, he tells his boss [[J.B. Nevercott]] about his saviors, and J.B. gifts the adventurers with the deed to Trollskull Manor.
