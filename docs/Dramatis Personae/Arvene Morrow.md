# Swordcaptain Arvene Morrow
![[ArveneMorrow.png]]
Swordcaptain Arvene Morrow is one of the top members of the City Watch. She tends to be straightforward and no-nonsense. When the Dock Ward had to be quarantined due to the spread of the Rat Pox, she put out a call for volunteers to venture past the quarantine line and try to figure out what caused the plague.
