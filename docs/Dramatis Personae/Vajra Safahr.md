![[VajraSafahr.png]]
Vajra Safahr is the current Blackstaff of Waterdeep. As such, she presides over Blackstaff Tower, where she trains apprentice wizards and manages Force Grey, the most elite enforcement and intelligence agents of Waterdeep. She reports directly to the Open Lord, Laeral Silverhand. Though sheâ€™s the youngest Blackstaff to ever hold the position, she is quite a formidable wizard.
