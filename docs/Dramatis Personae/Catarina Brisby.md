While investigating the murder of [[Gerald Brisby|Captain Gerald Brisby]], the player characters made a startling discovery: his daughter, Catarina, is the infamous Rat King.

It’s unknown when Catarina first became the Rat King, though it’s likely been at least a few years, and she’s probably now in her mid-thirties. A bundle of letters in Captain Brisby’s safety deposit box revealed that Catarina had been in a relationship with the [[Malad Song|Lord of Plagues]].
