# Malad Song
![[MaladSong.jpeg]]
Not much is known about Malad, the Lord of Plagues, except that he apparently holds a grudge against [[Catarina Brisby]] for ending their relationship. 

Letters taken from the safety deposit box of  [[Gerald Brisby|Captain Gerald Brisby]] revealed that Malad had been developing a potion that could turn people into rats, but that he promised never to use it. The Rat King was convinced that this promise had been broken following their breakup. However, this was not true; in his anger about being falsely accused, Malad planned to actually unleash a refined strain of the plague during the Salvation Parade.
